# minnesota-phd-trade-2025

This Mike's course site and repository for his part of the University of Minnesota Course Econ 8403 (part of the Phd Trade Sequence) which is co-taught with Doireann Fitzgerald.

This course will focus on **trade policy** with a particular focus on quantitative aspects of trade policy. 

You'd have to be totally clueless to not realize trade policy is one of the most pressing issues today (second week of January 2025). The US (and the world) is embarking on one of the largest revisions of the world trading system in the past 80 years. This raises many questions of interest to the research community, policy makers, and general public. 

Now the theory of trade policy has seen some very important contributions. However, this aspect of the field has not kept up with the quantitative revolution in trade over the past 20 years. 

The goal is to learn the core theoretical contributions and then be able to think about magnitudes and areas for future investigation (especially on the measurement side).

The basic plan is to cover the following:

* The optimal tariff: [Dixit 1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1573442085800094)

* Political economy arguments for tariffs: [Grossman Helpman 1994](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118033)

* Quantitative analysis of optimal tariffs and trade wars: [Ossa 2014](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.12.4104) and [Adao, Costinot, Donaldson](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31798)

* Connection with US-China trade war and Eaton and Kortum trade models: [Caliendo and Parro 2021](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29051)

Deliverables:

 * One problem set for me. It will be focused on computation.

 * Possibly a group presentation. This will be discussed jointly with Doireann and I
